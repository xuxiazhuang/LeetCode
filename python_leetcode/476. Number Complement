Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.



solution:
class Solution(object):
    def findComplement(self, num):
        i = 1
        while i <= num:
            i = i << 1
        return (i - 1) ^ num
