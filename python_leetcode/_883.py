On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j).

Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.

Example 3:

Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8
Example 4:

Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14
Example 5:

Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21







solution:
 plane_xy = sum(v > 0 for row in grid for v in row)
 plane_xz = sum(max(row) for row in grid)
 plane_yz = sum(max(col) for col in zip(*grid))
 return plane_xy + plane_xz + plane_yz
