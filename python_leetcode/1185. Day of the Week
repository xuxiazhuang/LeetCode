The input is given as three integers representing the day, month and year respectively.

Return the answer as one of the following values {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}.


solution：
from datetime import date
class Solution(object):
    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day, month, year):
        return date(year, month, day).strftime("%A")

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now() # current date and time
year = now.strftime("%Y")
print("year:", year)
month = now.strftime("%m")
print("month:", month)
day = now.strftime("%d")
print("day:", day)
